# busybulkcopy

This is based on a project that I found on CodePlex. 

Changes made:
- Added a couple of DB Types that were missing
- Added NLOG as a dependancy and changed the console writes to use NLOG instead.
- The original code as downloaded is available in the /Original folder. This is a zip file. Unfortunately there is nothing I can see that allows the recognition of the original author(s).

I have kept the name the same so if others are searching after CodePlex disappears they may access the original code.
